# 4DVisualizationTest

There are currently 2 main ways to visualize 4d objects, Stereographic projections and Crossection projections
Stereographic projections work by scaling the points of a 4d object based on the distance to some other point in space,  it can be thought of as taking a 3 dimensional shadow of 4d object.

mathematically this model is equivlent to dividing all vertices on the cube by the distance of an arbitrary point.

The second Method works like an MRI Scan but instead of taking 2d slices of a 3d object it takes 3d slices of a 4d object

<details>
<summary>the main issue with both of these projections is that they do not provide a satisfiying way to navigate a 4d environment.</summary>
  - cross section does not allow you to see anything past your 3d plane
  - stereo graphic independent of camera and therfore does not give any information
</details>

I believe that the solution to this is to define a 4d camera in space with a custom projection matrix that works on 2 axis instead of just one . 
the way this projection matrix would work is that first all objects would be projected onto a single "hyper plane" perpedicula, the projection would be double sided so all vertices above and bellow that plane would be projected onto it, now that all vertices have been scaled you can then zero out that demension. once you have the vertices in this state you can then do a standard projection back to the camera. with this you are able all aswell as judge its depth within . 4d space

- to illustrate this its much easier to think of a 2d case where you project 3d image onto a 1d screen then extrapolate that to 4d





This is a standard cube, notice how the back most face is farther to the right than the front most face when the cube moves left due to the perspective projection

This is a Stereographic projection of a Tesseract

This is the same cube, notice how the inner cube does not move relative to the outer cube like you would expect following the logic of the perspective projection shown in the first image

This is an Artistic represention of how a perspective projection of a 4d cube would look like when viewed from the front

This is the same cube viewed from a different angle
