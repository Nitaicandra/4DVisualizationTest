# 4DVisualizationTest
This project will discribe a new method for 4d projection

|The main approach for visualizing 4d objects is stereographic projection.|

|You can think of a stereographic projections as casting a light on an object and then rendnering the shadow created from the result. this method can be generalized to 4d objects meaning that instead of taking 2d shadow of a 3d object you are takine a 3d shadow of a 4d object |

|Mathematically this is achieved by assigning an extra coordiante to each vertice (xyzw) and definig a "light source" with an arbitrary location in 4d space. Then going into local space and dividing each coordinate of every vertice by the w distance from the "light source".  Then you can discard the w coordinate and render the scene normally. This will result in verticies further away from the light source being shrunk towards the orgin of the object, which is what creates the inner cube seen in a tesseract|

however the problem with this is that although you can visualize 4d rotations of the objects, you cant visualize 4d rotations of the camera because the camera is not defined in 4d space only the light and objects are.
In addition to that it doesnt perserve the rules of perspective. For example here is a stereographic projection of a normal cube.

This is a perspective projection of that same cube, notice how the back most face of the cube is farther to the right than the front most face when the cube moves left.

This is the tesseract shown earlier, if it followed perspective then you would expect the inner cube to displace towards the right like the normal cube

Inorder to perserve this perspective effect and also allow for 4d camera movements ive come up with a new method of projection. Instead of simply dividing each coordinate by the distance to an arbitrary point, you create a 4d camera and then convert each vertice into the 4d camera's local coordinate frame then you project those vertices back into 3d space from within those local coodinates then you finally project those coordinates to your screen using another projection matrix. And because the projection is defined from the cameras local coordinates objects will properly react to both 4d and 3d rotations and movement
Here is a visualization of how this projection would appear using my method

currently im in the process of formalizing this model of projection mathematically. And i will update the repository with the finale formulas when finished
