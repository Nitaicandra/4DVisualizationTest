# 4DVisualizationTest
This project will discribe a new method for 4d projection

|Here is the new method in action.|

|The main approach for visualizing 4d objects is through a lightsource projection.|

|You can think of this methode as casting a light on an object and then rendnering the shadow created from that object. This method can be generalized to 4d objects meaning that instead of taking 2d shadow of a 3d object you are taking a 3d shadow of a 4d object |

|Mathematically this is achieved by first assigning an extra coordiante to each vertice (xyzw) and then definig a "light source" with an arbitrary location in 4d space. Then once you have that light source you measure the distance of each vertice from that lightsource in the w dimension and then divide the each vertice by that distance. After you do that for every vertice you can discard the w coordinates and render the cube normally. This will result in verticies that were orginally further away from the light source in the w dimension being placed closer to the orgin of the object in 3d space, which is what creates the inner cube seen in a tesseract projection|

however the problem with this is that even though you can visualize 4d rotations of the tessearct, you cant visualize 4d rotations of the camera because the camera is not defined in 4d space only the light source and objects are.
In addition to that it doesnt perserve the rules of perspective. For example here is a stereographic projection of a normal cube.

And this is a perspective projection of that same cube, notice how when the cube moves left the back most face of the cube is farther to the right than the front most face.

This is a stereographic projection of a tesseract, if it followed perspective then you would expect when the tesseract move left then the inner cube would be  displace towards the right like the normal cube

Inorder to perserve this perspective effect and also allow for 4d camera movements ive come up with a new method of projection. 
Instead of simply dividing each coordinate by the distance to an arbitrary 4d point, you define a 4dimensional camera using the gramschmidt methode and then transfer each vertice into that 4d camera's local coordinate frame. Then After that you can project those vertices back into 3d space from within those local coodinates. 
The key diffrence being that instead of the projection being independent of the camera like before it is a part of the camera, which allows you to properly define 4d camera movements and perserve 4th dimensional perspective and depth
Here is a visualization of how a tesseract would appear using my method in 2d and 3d
