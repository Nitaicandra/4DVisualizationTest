# 4DVisualizationTest
This project will discribe a new method for 4d projection

|The main approach for visualizing 4d objects is through stereographic projection.|

|You can think of a stereographic projections as casting a light on an object and then rendnering the shadow created from that object. This method can be generalized to 4d objects meaning that instead of taking 2d shadow of a 3d object you are taking a 3d shadow of a 4d object |

|Mathematically this is achieved by first assigning an extra coordiante to each vertice (xyzw) and definig a "light source" with an arbitrary location in 4d space. Then once you have that light source you measure the distance of each vertice from that lightsource in the w dimension and divide the objects local coordinates by that distance. After you do that for every vertice you can discard the w coordinates for each of them and render the scene normally. This will result in verticies that were orginally further away from the light source in the w dimension being placed closer to the orgin of the object, which is what creates the inner cube seen in a tesseract projection|

however the problem with this is that although you can visualize 4d rotations of the objects, you cant visualize 4d rotations of the camera because the camera is not defined in 4d space only the light source and objects are.
In addition to that it doesnt perserve the rules of perspective. For example here is a stereographic projection of a normal cube.

And this is a perspective projection of that same cube, notice how when the cube moves left the back most face of the cube is farther to the right than the front most face.

This is a stereographic projection of a tesseract, if it followed perspective then you would expect when the tesseract move left then the inner cube would be  displace towards the right like the normal cube

Inorder to perserve this perspective effect and also allow for 4d camera movements ive come up with a new method of projection. Instead of simply dividing each coordinate by the distance to an arbitrary 4d point, you define a 4dimensional camera and then convert each vertice into that 4d camera's local coordinate frame. then you project those vertices back into 3d space from within those local coodinates. The key diffrence being that instead of the projection being independent of the camera like before it is a part of the camera, which then allows you to properly define 4d camera movements and perserve 4th dimensional perspective and depth
Here is a visualization of how a tesseract would appear when moving using my method

currently im in the process of formalizing this model of projection mathematically. And i will update the repository with the finale formulas when finished
*update i have finshed it i have fair degree of certinty that the math is correct i will be creating a video on it and once thats done i will update the repo wiht the code*
